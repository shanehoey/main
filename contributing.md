# How to Contribute

This Mediant Powershell Module is a module I've been using for years personnaly. It will always need new improvements, therefore Contributions in the form of issues and pull requests are welcomed and encouraged.


Why not [submit an issue](https://github.com/shanehoey/mediant/issues/new) or create [a pull request](https://github.com/shanehoey/mediant/pulls).


## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request: 

1. Clone the Repo.
2. Create a branch off `master` and give it a meaningful name (eg `My-New-feature` or `new-fix-#123`) and describe the feature or fix. 
3. Open a pull requeast on GitHub.
